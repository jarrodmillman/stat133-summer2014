## Course Description

An introduction to computationally intensive applied statistics. Topics may
include organization and use of databases, visualization and graphics,
statistical learning and data mining, model validation procedures, and the
presentation of results.

**Prerequisites**: Familiarity with basic concepts in probability and statistics is important.
Being comfortable with matrices, vectors, basic set theory, functions, and graphs will also help.
There is no prerequisite for programming: we will learn how to program with data from scratch!

### Topics

The goal of this course is to introduce you to a variety of programs and
technologies that are useful for organizing, manipulating and visualizing data. 
This includes:

* Basic understanding of computers and networks
* Working at the (Bash) command line
* Regular expressions
* Scientific computing with Python including NumPy, SciPy, and matplotlib
* File formats including CSV, JSON, HDF5, and XML
* Clustering, classification, and linear regression
* Basic knowledge of R

## Grading

* Grading Policies: 25% midterm, 25% final exam, 20% labs, and 30% project.
* Course Policies: There will be no makeup midterm nor final exam. No late homework will be accepted.
  Grades of Incomplete will be granted only for dire medical or personal emergencies that cause you
  to miss the final, and only if your work up to that point has been satisfactory.
