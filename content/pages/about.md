## Course Catalog Description

An introduction to computationally intensive applied statistics. Topics will
include organization and use of databases, visualization and graphics,
statistical learning and data mining, model validation procedures, and the
presentation of results.

* Prerequisites: Familiarity with basic concepts in probability and statistics is important.
  Being comfortable with matrices, vectors, basic set theory, functions, and graphs will also help.
  There is no prerequisite for programming: we will learn how to program with data from scratch!

## Grading

* Grading Policies: 25% midterm, 25% final exam, 20% labs, and 30% project.
* Course Policies: There will be no makeup midterm nor final exam. No late homework will be accepted.
  Grades of Incomplete will be granted only for dire medical or personal emergencies that cause you
