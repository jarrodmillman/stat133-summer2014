Computing
=========

"Computing's core challenge is how not to make a mess of it."

-- `Edsger W. Dijkstra <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edsger_W._Dijkstra>`_,

Radical novelty 1
=================

"The first radical novelty is a direct consequence of the raw power of today's
computing equipment. We all know how we cope with something big and complex;
divide and rule, i.e. we view the whole as a compositum of parts and deal with
the parts separately. And if a part is too big, we repeat the procedure. The
town is made up from neighbourhoods, which are structured by streets, which
contain buildings, which are made from walls and floors, that are built from
bricks, etc. eventually down to the elementary particles."

-- `Edsger W. Dijkstra <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edsger_W._Dijkstra>`_,

Radical novelty 2
=================

"The second radical novelty is that the automatic computer is our first
large-scale digital device. We had a few with a noticeable discrete component:
I just mentioned the cash register and can add the typewriter with its
individual keys: with a single stroke you can type either a Q or a W but,
though their keys are next to each other, not a mixture of those two letters.
But such mechanisms are the exception, and the vast majority of our mechanisms
are viewed as analogue devices whose behaviour is over a large range a
continuous function of all parameters involved: if we press the point of the
pencil a little bit harder, we get a slightly thicker line, if the violinist
slightly misplaces his finger, he plays slightly out of tune."
