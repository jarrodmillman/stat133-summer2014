IPython Notebook format) on Reproducible Science And Modern Scientific
Software <https://github.com/fperez/reprosw>`_.

Version control
===============

The basic idea is that instead of manually trying to keep track of what
changes you've made to code, data, documents, you use software to help
you manage the process. This has several benefits:

-  easily allowing you to go back to earlier versions
-  allowing you to have multiple version you can switch between
-  allowing you to share work easily without worrying about conflicts
-  providing built-in backup

At a basic level, a simple principle is to have version numbers for all
your work: code, datasets, manuscripts. Whenever you make a change to a
dataset, increment the version number. For code and manuscripts,
increment when you make substantial changes or have obvious breakpoints
in your workflow.

Version control architectures
=============================

-  Client-server (e.g., CVS, Subversion)
-  Distributed (e.g., Mercurial, **Git**)

Git concepts: commit

Git concepts: hash
==================

toy "implementation"::

  library('digest')
  
  # first commit
  data1 = 'This is the start of my paper2.'
  meta1 = 'date: 8/20/13'
  hash1 = digest(c(data1,meta1), algo="sha1")
  cat('Hash:', hash1)
  
  # second commit, linked to the first
  data2 = 'Some more text in my paper...'
  meta2 = 'date: 8/20/13'
  # Note we add the parent hash here!
  hash2 = digest(c(data2,meta2,hash1), algo="sha1")
  cat('Hash:', hash2)


Stage 1: Local, single-user, linear workflow
============================================

Simply type ``git`` (or ``git help``) to see a list of the
'core' commands, which will look like this::

  $ git
  usage: git <command> [<args>]
  
  The most commonly used git commands are:
     add        Add file contents to the index
     config     Get and set options
     clone      Clone a repository
     commit     Record changes to the repository
     init       Create an empty Git repository
     log        Show commit logs
     push       Update remote 
     status     Show the working tree status


``git init``: create an empty repository
========================================

First create an empty repository::

  cd ~/src
  git init demo

Let's look at what git did::

  cd demo
  ls -la
  ls -l .git

``git add``: adding content to the repository
=============================================

Now let's edit our first file in the test directory with a text
editor... I'm doing it programatically here for automation purposes, but
you'd normally be editing by hand::

  cd ~/src/demo
  echo "My first bit of text" > file1.txt

Now we can tell git about this new file using the ``add`` command::

  git add file1.txt

We can now ask git about what happened with ``status``::

  git status

``git commit``: permanently record our changes in git's database
================================================================

Now we are ready to commit our changes::

  git commit -m "This is our first commit"

In the commit above, we used the ``-m`` flag to specify a message at the
command line. If we don't do that, git will open the editor we specified
in our configuration above and require that we enter a message. By
default, git refuses to record changes that don't have a message to go
along with them (though you can obviously 'cheat' by using an empty or
meaningless string: git only tries to facilitate best practices, it's
not your nanny).

``git log``: what has been committed so far
===========================================

To see a log of the commits::

  git log

``git diff``: what have I changed?
==================================

Let's do a little bit more work... Again, in practice you'll be editing
the files by hand, here we do it via shell commands for the sake of
automation (and therefore the reproducibility of this tutorial!)

::

  echo "And now some more text..." >> file1.txt

And now we can ask git what is different::

  git diff

The cycle of git virtue: work, add, commit, ...
===============================================

::

  echo "Great progress ..." >> file1.txt
  git add file1.txt
  git commit -m "Great progress on this matter."

``git log`` revisited
=====================

First, let's see what the log shows us now::

  git log

Sometimes it's handy to see a very summarized version of the log::

  git log --oneline --topo-order --graph

Git supports *aliases:* new names given to command combinations. Let's
make this handy shortlog an alias, so we only have to type ``git slog``
and see this compact log::

  # We create our alias (this saves it in git's permanent configuration file):
  git config --global alias.slog "log --oneline --topo-order --graph"
  # And now we can use it git slog

``git mv`` and ``rm``: moving and removing files
================================================

While ``git add`` is used to add files to the list git tracks, we must
also tell it if we want their names to change or for it to stop tracking
them. In familiar Unix fashion, the ``mv`` and ``rm`` git commands do
precisely this::

  git mv file1.txt file-newname.txt
  git status

Note that these changes must be committed too, to become permanent! In
git's world, until something hasn't been committed, it isn't permanently
recorded anywhere::
  
  git commit -m "I like this new name better"
  git slog

And ``git rm`` works in a similar fashion.

Exercise
========

Add a new file ``file2.txt``, commit it, make some changes to it, commit
them again, and then remove it (and don't forget to commit this last
step!).

Local user, branching: the concept
==================================

What is a branch? Simply a *label for the 'current' commit in a sequence
of ongoing commits*:

Local user, branching: the concept
==================================

There can be multiple branches alive at any point in time; the working
directory is the state of a special pointer called HEAD. In this example
there are two branches, *master* and *testing*, and *testing* is the
currently active branch since it's what HEAD points to:

Local user, branching: the concept
==================================

Once new commits are made on a branch, HEAD and the branch label move
with the new commits:

Local user, branching: the concept
==================================

This allows the history of both branches to diverge:

Local user, branching: the concept
==================================

But based on this graph structure, git can compute the necessary
information to merge the divergent branches back and continue with a
unified line of development:

Local user, branching: an example
=================================

Let's now illustrate all of this with a concrete example. Let's get our
bearings first::

  git status
  ls

We are now going to try two different routes of development: on the
``master`` branch we will add one file and on the ``experiment`` branch,
which we will create, we will add a different one. We will then merge
the experimental branch into ``master``.

Local user, branching: an example
=================================

Create and work on an experimental branch::

  git branch experiment
  git checkout experiment
  echo "Some crazy idea" > experiment.txt
  git add experiment.txt
  git commit -m "Trying something new"
  git slog

Local user, branching: an example
=================================

Work on the master branch::

  git checkout master
  git slog
  echo "Work goes on in master..." >> file-newname.txt
  git add file-newname.txt
  git commit -m "The mainline keeps moving"
  git slog

Local user, branching: an example
=================================

Now merge experimental branch::

  ls
  git merge experiment
  git slog

Using remotes as a single user
==============================

We are now going to introduce the concept of a *remote repository*: a
pointer to another copy of the repository that lives on a different
location. This can be simply a different path on the filesystem or a
server on the internet.

For this discussion, we'll be using remotes hosted on the
`GitHub.com <http://github.com>`__ service, but you can equally use
other services like `BitBucket <http://bitbucket.org>`__ or
`Gitorious <http://gitorious.org>`__ as well as host your own.

::

  git remote -v

Since the above cell didn't produce any output after the
``git remote -v`` call, it means we have no remote repositories
configured. We will now proceed to do so.

Using remotes as a single user
==============================

Once logged into GitHub, go to
the `new repository page <https://github.com/new>`__ and make a
repository called ``test``. Do **not** check the box that says
``Initialize this repository with a README``, since we already have an
existing repository here. That option is useful when you're starting
first at Github and don't have a repo made already on a local computer.

Using remotes as a single user
==============================

We can now follow the instructions from the next page::

  git remote add origin git@github.com:jarrodmillman/test.git
  git push -u origin master

Let's see the remote situation again::

  git remote -v

We can now `see this repository publicly on
github <https://github.com/jarrodmillman/test>`__.

Using remotes as a single user
==============================

Let's see how this can be useful for backup and syncing work between two
different computers. I'll simulate a 2nd computer by working in a
different directory...

::

  cd ~/src/
  # Here I clone my 'test' repo but with a different name, test2,
  # to simulate a 2nd computer
  git clone git@github.com:jarrodmillman/test.git test2
  cd test2
  pwd
  git remote -v

Using remotes as a single user
==============================

Let's now make some changes in one 'computer' and synchronize them on
the second.

::

  cd ~/src/test2
  # working on computer #2
  echo "More new content on my experiment" >> experiment.txt
  git add experiment.txt
  git commit -m "More work, on machine #2"

Using remotes as a single user
==============================

Now we put this new work up on the github server so it's available from
the internet::

  # working on computer #2
  git push

Now let's fetch that work from machine #1::

  cd ~/src/demo
  git pull

An important aside: conflict management
=======================================

While git is very good at merging, if two different branches modify the
same file in the same location, it simply can't decide which change
should prevail. At that point, human intervention is necessary to make
the decision. Git will help you by marking the location in the file that
has a problem, but it's up to you to resolve the conflict. Let's see how
that works by intentionally creating a conflict.

We start by creating a branch and making a change to our experiment
file::

  git branch trouble
  git checkout trouble
  echo "This is going to be a problem..." >> experiment.txt
  git add experiment.txt
  git commit -m "Changes in the trouble branch"

An important aside: conflict management
=======================================

And now we go back to the master branch, where we change the *same*
file::

  git checkout master
  echo "More work on the master branch..." >> experiment.txt
  git add experiment.txt
  git commit -m "Mainline work"``

So now let's see what happens if we try to merge the ``trouble`` branch
into ``master``::

  git merge trouble

Let's see what git has put into our file::

  cat experiment.txt

An important aside: conflict management
=======================================

At this point, we go into the file with a text editor, decide which
changes to keep, and make a new commit that records our decision. To
automate my edits, I use the ``sed`` command::

  sed -i '/^</d' experiment.txt
  sed -i '/^>/d' experiment.txt
  sed -i '/^=/d' experiment.txt

An important aside: conflict management
=======================================

I've now made the edits, in this case I decided that both pieces of text
were useful, so I just accepted both additions.

::

  cat experiment.txt

Let's then make our new commit::

  git add experiment.txt
  git commit -m "Completed merge of trouble, fixing conflicts along the way"
  git slog

An important aside: conflict management
=======================================

*Note:* While it's a good idea to understand the basics of fixing merge
conflicts by hand, in some cases you may find the use of an automated
tool useful. Git supports multiple `merge
tools <https://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/git-mergetool.html>`__:
a merge tool is a piece of software that conforms to a basic interface
and knows how to merge two files into a new one. Since these are
typically graphical tools, there are various to choose from for the
different operating systems, and as long as they obey a basic command
structure, git can work with any of them.
