For those of you who installed TextWrangler today, you should note that it does
not perform syntax highlighting for R. While this is not necessary to write
your programs, it makes the process much easier. [This
site](https://files.nyu.edu/jmb736/public/projects/R.html) has information on
how to add a module that supports syntax highlighting in R. Just follow the
instructions under the Language Module part of the article. If you have any
issues let me know.
