In the first lab, we will deal with installation issues.  You will **need**
to bring your laptop to lab.  For installation instructions, please see the
[Software](|filename|/pages/software.md) page.

During future lectures and labs, we will make heavy use of Git and GitHub.
Every student will need a Github student account for submitting their lab work:

1. [Create account](https://github.com/join)
2. [Request a student account](https://github.com/edu)
