In this lab, you will:

1. Setup ``git``
2. Create a private homework repository on Github
3. Create an ``info.r`` file

You will need:

1. A Github educational account
2. If you are using your own laptop, please install relevant [software](pages/software)

## Setup ``git``

You will be using ``git`` to submit **every lab assignment for grading**.

``git`` is an extremely powerful version control system widely used in the
open source scientific computing community.  Rather than trying to learn
everything that you can about ``git`` right away, you will only be learning
the things you need to immediately use.  Over the next several weeks, you
will incrementally learn how to use more of its features.

``git`` commands are run through a shell prompt. You can interact with shell prompts
via Terminal (on OSX) or Git Bash (on Windows). If you are using OSX,
Terminal comes pre-installed. If you are using Windows, you will need to install
Git bash by following the instructions [here](pages/software). Entering ``git``
at a shell prompt, will produce output something like this (try this on your own
computer):

```bash
$ git
usage: git <command> [<args>]

The most commonly used git commands are:
   add        Add file contents to the index
   config     Get and set repository or global options
   clone      Clone a repository into a new directory   
   commit     Record changes to the repository
   log        Show commit logs
   push       Update remote refs along with associated objects
   status     Show the working tree status

'git help -a' and 'git help -g' lists available subcommands and some
concept guides. See 'git help <command>' or 'git help <concept>'
to read about a specific subcommand or concept.
```

When you try this on your computer, you will see much more information.
I've reduced the output so that it only contains information relevant
for today's lab.

The first thing you need to do is configure ``git``.  Here is what
I did on my machine, you should use your own name and email address!

```bash
git config --global user.name "Karl Kumbier"
git config --global user.email "kkumbier@berkeley.edu"
```

## Create a private homework repository on Github

Make sure you are logged onto Github.  In your user bar at the top right
of any Github page, click the ["Create a New Repo"](https://github.com/new)
button:

![Create New Repo]({filename}/images/github_create_new_repo.png)
 
This will take you to a new page where you will:

1. Name your repository "stat133"
2. Make sure it is private
3. Select "Initialize this repository with a README"
4. Choose "R" in the pull-down menu to add a .gitignore file

Your screen should look like this (except ``karlkumbier`` will
be replaced by your Github name):

![Create New Github Repo]({filename}/images/github_new_repo.png)

Once you click the "Create repository" button, you should see a
page like this:

![Your New Repo]({filename}/images/github_s133_repo.png)

In order for me to see (and grade) your private repository, you will
need to add me as a colloborator.  In the lower right-hand corner of
your repositories main page, you should see a button labelled
"Settings".  Click on the "Settings" button will take you to
a page where you can edit various settings for your repository.
Choose the "Collaborators" button on the "Settings" page and
add me, ``karlkumbier``, as well as the instructor ``ingileif``,
and``jarrodmillman`` (developer).

### Clone repository to your local machine

First you will create a ``src`` subdirectory in your home directory.  Then you
will clone your repo inside of the ``src`` subdirectory.  Please make sure to
use your own Github username instead of mine. Running the following commands at
a shell prompt will create a new directory ``src`` inside your home directory
and clone the repository you just created on Github to your machine:

```bash
$ cd            # go to your home directory
$ mkdir src     # make a source subdirectory
$ cd src
$ git clone https://github.com/karlkumbier/stat133.git
Cloning into 'stat133'...
Username for 'https://github.com': karlkumbier
Password for 'https://karlkumbier@github.com': 
remote: Counting objects: 4, done.
remote: Compressing objects: 100% (3/3), done.
remote: Total 4 (delta 0), reused 0 (delta 0)
Unpacking objects: 100% (4/4), done.
Checking connectivity... done.
```
Now take a look at what is inside your repo:

```bash
$ cd stat133/
$ ls
README.md
$ ls -a
.  ..  .git  .gitignore  README.md
```

## Create an ``info.r`` file

Now that you have a local copy of your repo, you will need to add
some new content.

First, make sure you are in the top-level directory of your newly
cloned repository (note: you will be in the correct location if
you haven't changed directories since entering the above commands):

```bash
pwd
```

If you aren't in the correct directory, you need to change your working directory:

```bash
cd ~/src/stat133
```

Open your text editor and create a new file, called ``info.r``.  If you are
using RStudio, you should create this file in the text editor window (upper left
by default) and save it to your newly cloned stat133 directory. Add the
following content (*make sure to replace the information I have supplied WITH
YOUR OWN INFO*:

```Rscript
name = "Karl Kumbier"
SID = "0123456789"
email = "name@berkeley.edu"
github_name = "karlkumbier"
status = "enrolled"
```

Note: ``status`` in ('enrolled', 'audit')

Next you will query the status of your ``git`` repo:

```bash
$ git status 
On branch master
Your branch is up-to-date with 'origin/master'.

Untracked files:
  (use "git add <file>..." to include in what will be committed)

        info.R

nothing added to commit but untracked files present (use "git add" to track)
```

As you should see, ``git`` tells you that there is a new file that is not
being tracked.  Following the advice, try adding your new file to the repo:

```bash
git add info.r 
```

Now check on the status of your repo again:

```bash
$ git status 
On branch master
Your branch is up-to-date with 'origin/master'.

Changes to be committed:
  (use "git reset HEAD <file>..." to unstage)

        new file:   info.r
```

Everything looks good, so go ahead and commit your change:

```bash
$ git commit -m "Add personal info"
[master bbc329f] Add personal info
 1 file changed, 4 insertions(+)
 create mode 100644 info.r
```

Next take a look at a log of what's been done:

```bash
$ git log 
commit bbc329fe5f0672582a3ad3c70f5b86f4acc15f63
Author: Karl Kumbier <kkumbier@berkeley.edu>
Date:   Wed Jan 29 14:19:38 2014 -0800

    Add personal info

commit dead6f41c65e50f444760653205e21083caabfcc
Author: Karl Kumbier <kkumbier@berkeley.edu>
Date:   Tue Jan 28 22:29:33 2014 -0800

    Initial commit
```

At this point you've created a new file, added it to your
repo, and committed the current state of your repo.  This
was all done locally, so the next thing to do is push these
changes back up to your remote Github repo:

```bash
$ git push 
Username for 'https://github.com': karlkumbier
Password for 'https://karlkumbier@github.com': 
Counting objects: 4, done.
Delta compression using up to 4 threads.
Compressing objects: 100% (3/3), done.
Writing objects: 100% (3/3), 359 bytes | 0 bytes/s, done.
Total 3 (delta 1), reused 0 (delta 0)
To https://github.com/karlkumbier/stat133
   dead6f4..bbc329f  master -> master
```

At this point, your Github repository main page should look
something like this:

![Your New Repo]({filename}/images/github_s133_repo_2ndcommit.png)

Note that there is now a new file and the number of commits has
been incremented to 2.
