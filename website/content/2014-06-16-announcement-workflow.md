Here's a short summary of the basic workflow that we covered today. We'll be
using it for homeworks, quizzez, etc. so it should start to come more naturally.

1. Navigate to your stat133 directory (in Bash)
2. Run the ```git pull``` command (in Bash)
3. Make changes to the files (in your text editor)
4. Save the changes you made (in your text editor)
5. Run the ```git add <filename>``` command (in Bash)
6. Run the ```git commit -m "put some informative message here"``` command (in
Bash)
7. Run the ```git push``` command (in Bash)

At various points throughout the process, you may be prompted for you GitHub
username and password. You can also use the ```git status``` and ```git diff```
commands (in Bash) to get more information about changes you have made.
