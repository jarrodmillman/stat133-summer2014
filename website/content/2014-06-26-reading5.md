For those interested in understanding PCA better, I recommend the following
optional reading:

*  Jonathon Shlens' [A Tutorial on Principal Component
      Analysis](http://arxiv.org/abs/1404.1100)

And if you've become even slightly interested in Vim, you may be interested in
reading this optional blog post:

* [Vim for people who think things like Vim are weird and
   hard](http://csswizardry.com/2014/06/vim-for-people-who-think-things-like-vim-are-weird-and-hard/)
