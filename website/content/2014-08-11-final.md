What to know
------------


- filesystem hierarchy

        - R has extensive built-in functions
        - vector-centric
        - ?<function> to find options
        - scope:  local is good
        - return: explicit is better than implicit
        - encapsulation: e.g., return multiple things w/ a list
        - unit tests: "Testing shows the presence, not the absence of bugs."

      - clustering

    - Divide et impera (Divide and conqueror)
    - Learn the idiom
      - language makes some things easier to express than others


Format
------

- similar to labs and homeworks

```bash
$ cd <my local repo>
$ git pull
$ cd final
$ ls
<snip>
$ edit <file(s)>
$ Rscript <R file>  # QUICK CHECK
```

The best way to check that you have a valid R file is to use the ```source```
command from the R prompt.

```bash
> source(<R file)   # BETTER CHECK
```

Once you are ready to commit and submit some changes, you should use ```git```
per usual.  Feel free to commit and push regularly.  I will grade whatever
you push last.

```bash
$ git add <file(s)>
$ git commit (-m "Clear message for humans")
$ git push
```

- NO communication with others
    - You may use your computer to query search engines
      - I wouldn't want to rely on this
      - Do look up error messages, if you don't understand them
    - I would try to rely on the reference card, slides, and ?
    - Make little test cases

- There will be several proctors
    - You can ask anything
    - We will answer questions about 
    - Any cheating will result in at least one of the following:
        - 0 for the midterm
        - F for the course
        - Report to the Office of Student Conduct
