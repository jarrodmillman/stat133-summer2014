## Course Description

An introduction to computationally intensive applied statistics. Topics may
include organization and use of databases, visualization and graphics,
statistical learning and data mining, model validation procedures, and the
presentation of results.

**Prerequisites**: Familiarity with basic concepts in probability and
statistics is important.  Being comfortable with matrices, vectors, basic set
theory, functions, and graphs will also help.  There is no prerequisite for
programming.

### Topics

The goal of this course is to introduce you to a variety of programs and
technologies that are useful for organizing, manipulating, and visualizing data
with a focus on the R statistical computing environment.  Topics may include:

* Basic understanding of computers and networks
* Working at the (Bash) command line
* Implementing reproducible research
* Open source development practice
* Version control using Git and GitHub
* Understanding regular expressions
* Basics of programming (data structures, control flow, debugging, etc.)
* Simulation and random number generation
* Exploratory data analysis and dimension reduction (PCA)
* File formats including CSV, JSON, HDF5, and XML
* Process automation with Make
* Document generation using $\LaTeX$, Markdown, reStructuredText, Sphinx, and Pelican
* Clustering, classification, and linear regression
* Brief introduction to scientific computing with Python

## Grading

Your final grade will be a weighted average of grades in the following areas:

* 5% participation
* 40% labs and/or homework
* 15% midterm
* 20% group project - due at the end of semester
* 20% final exam

## Course Policies

**Attendance and behavior in class:** You are expected to attend all lectures
and labs.  Any known or potential extracurricular conflicts should be discussed
in person with the instructor during the first two weeks of the semester, or as
soon as they arise. *Cellphones* are to be turned off during class time.
*Laptop* use during class is recommend, but it is expected that you will be
using your laptop to type along with the lecture.

**Submission of assignments:** Assignments will be accepted by electronic
submission to GitHub only.  There will be no makeup midterm nor final exam. No
late labs or homework will be accepted.  Grades of Incomplete will be granted
only for dire medical or personal emergencies that cause you to miss the final,
and only if your work up to that point has been satisfactory.

**Academic integrity:** Any test, paper, or report submitted by you is presumed
to be your own original work that has not previously been submitted for credit
in another course. While you are encouraged to work together on homework
assignments, the work and writeup must be your own. For example, suggesting a
function to another student is acceptable, whereas simply giving him or her
your own code is not.  If you are not clear about the expectations for
completing an assignment or taking an exam, be sure to seek clarification from
the instructor or GSI beforehand. Any evidence of cheating and plagiarism will
be subject to disciplinary action.  Please read the [Honor
Code](http://asuc.org/honorcode/index.php) carefully.

**Students with disabilities:** If you need accommodations for any physical,
psychological, or learning disability, please speak to me after class or during
office hours so that we can make the necessary arrangements.
